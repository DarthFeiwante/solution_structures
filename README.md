# solution_structures
Program is intended for making of the solid solution from some initial lattice

Requirements: python3

Program uses following moduli:
random, os, subprocess, copy, shutil, read_write_i

Input file - solution_structures.in with following parameters:
Description of the parameters see in example of the input file

Output data:
Structure files of solid solutions in rv_at format with corresponding visualization files in xyz format.
They can contain vacancies if structure type 'vacancy' was choosen.

Program can be used as importable or executable
